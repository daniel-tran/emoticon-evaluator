# emoticon-evaluator
A utility that helps determine if a string is a valid emoticon. Made using JavaScript and HTML.

Some questions you may have about the source code:


##Q. Why not just use Regex to do your string checking?

A. I can't seem to get composite regex expressions working properly, and the original source code
   was translated from older GML code for a game I intended on making but never did.
   
   
##Q. How come this wasn't initiallly started on Git from the ground-up?

A. A few factors have affected why this project is uploaded to Git when it happened:
   - Due to inexperience, I plan to learn and progressively ease into the Git environment.
     This is notable in my first repository, merio-reborn, which has just a single .exe file and
     some supplementary text files.
   - I haven't had much time in the last few months to work on this project, let alone, get
     into learning Git basics. So much of the work was done offline, but I've now reached a point
     where Git can certainly help via branching since I'm trying to change the overall implementation.
   
   
##Q. When will the project be finished?

A. Being my first Git project where I'm actually using source code control, I would imagine that
   this could extend into a long-term project in terms of code maintenance and updating.
   Having said that, I think when the main implementation is finished, certain revisions can
   be made available as pull requests.
