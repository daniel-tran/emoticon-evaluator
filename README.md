# emoticon-evaluator
A utility that helps determine if a string is a valid emoticon. Made using JavaScript and HTML.

Some questions you may have about the source code:

Q. Why not just use Regex to do your string checking?

A. I can't seem to get composite regex expressions working properly, and the original source code
   was translated from older GML code for a game I intended on making but never did.
   
Q. When will the project be finished?

A. Being my first Git project where I'm actually using source code control, I would imagine that
   this could extend into a long-term project in terms of code maintenance and updating.
   Having said that, I think when the main implementation is finished, certain revisions can
   be made available as pull requests.
